## Introduction

1.What is physiotherapy?

Physiotherapy is a treatment method for injuries or deformities using physical exercises.

 

2.What is Personal Physical Trainer?

Personal Physical Trainer is an innovation for physiotherapy. It creates an environment where the patients would be more willing to engage in physiotherapy   as well as it makes sure that patient would do the correct movements. This also allows the therapist to monitor the progress of his/hers patient and whether the patient carries out the necessary exercises.

3.Why should people use PPT?

There are millions and millions of people who do physiotherapy but  about 20% of them get cured in the relevant time period if we trace the causes for it we can see that most of the time people give up physiotherapy and they do not do the exercises they supposed to. One of the major draw back in traditional methods of physiotherapy is that therapist would examine the patient at the start of therapy and then again examine the patient after period of time. Within that time period the patient’s progress isn’t not monitored. So they tend not engage on exercises or some do not have a clue whether they are doing the correct movements.

4.How does PPT work?

We build a wearable to read the movements of the patient. A game is develop that would be controlled by the movements of the patients. In order to reach the goe als with in the game the patient has to engage in the correct movements themselves.  We record data that is needed for the therapist such as speed, time period patient engaged in the activity as well as number movement. With all the data therapist can monitor the patient’s development.
